# What is "Koboshi"?

Its name comes from [_Okiagari-Koboshi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okiagari-koboshi) which gets up whenever he tumbled.  
The app originally designed for restarting app when it crashed. I think it's like Okiagari-Koboshi.  

> Okiagari-koboshi or Okiagari-kobōshi (起き上がり小法師, getting-up little priest) is a Japanese traditional doll. The toy is made from papier-mâché and is designed so that its weight causes it to return to an upright position if it is knocked over. Okiagari-kobōshi is considered a good-luck charm and a symbol of perseverance and resilience.
